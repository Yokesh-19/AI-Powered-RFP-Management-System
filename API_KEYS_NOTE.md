# ⚠️ API Keys Included for Evaluation

This repository includes working API keys in `backend/.env` for immediate testing by interviewers.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yokesh-19/AI-Powered-RFP-Management-System.git
cd AI-Powered-RFP-Management-System

# Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Start MongoDB
net start MongoDB  # Windows

# Run
cd backend && npm run dev   # Terminal 1
cd frontend && npm start    # Terminal 2
```

**No API key setup needed** - Everything is pre-configured in `backend/.env`

**Note:** API keys are included for evaluation purposes only. In production, never commit secrets to Git.
